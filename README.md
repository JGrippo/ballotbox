# BallotBox

BallotBox serves as a cross-platform, anonymous voting system. 

Written using Ruby on Rails v4.5.1 for web; Objective-C and Swift for iOS; and Java for Android.

Platform specific progress is listed in READMEs within the specific directory (e.g. web progress can be found in ballot\_box\_web).
